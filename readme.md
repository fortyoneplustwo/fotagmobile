# Description
A photo gallery application written for Android mobile. The images are fetched from a URL and displayed within the app. Features include ability to rate images and filter images by rating.

# Acheivements
In order to display a list of vertically scrollable images, a custom adapter was implemented by extending the `BaseAdapter` class. This allows for list view optimization - it recycles the containers of images that go off-screen when the user scrolls.

# Credits
I used [Parcelabler by Dallas Gutauckis](http://www.parcelabler.com) to override the methods for `ImageData`.

# Install
Open as Android Studio project.
